A few applications on eye-blinking: Playing Chrome Dino, Drowsiness Detection, Put PC to sleep, Waking up sleepy user etc.
The description of each program is as follows:
1. Playing Chrome Dino with Eye: Dino jumps on blinking right eye and ducks on blinking left eye. By default, blinking both eyes performs jump.
2. Drowsiness Detection: Detects if user is drowsy by calculating the number of times user closes his eyes for a specific time or "bends his head down or sideways" which is not present in existing methods.
3. Lullaby: A useful program when you don't want to turn off your PC physically, like when you are watching a movie at night and PC is far away. Enables user to put a computer to sleep by just blinking eye continuously for a few seconds.
4. WakeUp: Want to night out? Use this program to keep you awake throughout the night especially during exams.

Otherwise, every time the user sleeps, it buzzes with given frequency and time, waking up the user. Also has the facility to let user set the loudness and time to buzz.
